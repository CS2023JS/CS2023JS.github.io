However, modern pizza as we know it today is believed to have originated in Naples, Italy in the 18th century. <br>Initially, pizza was sold on the streets and was a cheap and quick meal for the poor. However, as its popularity grew, it became a beloved dish among all classes in Italy and eventually spread throughout the world.
